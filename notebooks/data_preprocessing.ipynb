      "Medications: [\"General anesthesia\\n\\nIndications: 67 y o male with nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain,\\nelevated LFT and hypotension. ERCP to evaluate for biliary\\nobstruction. Level 3 consult was performed.\\n\\nProcedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential\\ncomplications were explained to the patient, who indicated his\\nunderstanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. The\\npatient was placed in the prone position and an endoscope was\\nintroduced through the mouth and advanced under direct\\nvisualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.\\nCareful visualization was performed. The procedure was not\\ndifficult. The quality of the preparation was good. The patient\\ntolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.\\nFindings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal\\nStomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal\\nDuodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal\\nMajor Papilla: Major papilla was located inside a diverticulum.\\n\\nCannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and\\ndeep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast\\nmedium was injected resulting in complete opacification. The\\nprocedure was not difficult. An additional cannulation attempt\\nof the biliary duct was successful and superficial with a\\nsphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was\\ninjected resulting in partial opacification. The procedure was\\nnot difficult.\\nBiliary Tree: Normal cholangiogram without biliary obstruction.\\nSmall stone in CBD can't be ruled out.  Opacified portion of\\npancreatic duct in the head was normal.\\nProcedures: A 9 cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **] biliary stent was\\nplaced successfully in the CBD .\\nImpression: 1. Major papilla was located inside a diverticulum.\\n\\n2. Normal cholangiogram without biliary obstruction. Small stone\\nin CBD can't be ruled out.\\n\\n3. Given sepsis of unclear source and the fact that a small\\nstone could not be ruled out, a  9 cm by 10 fr Cotton-[**Doctor Last Name **]\\nbiliary stent was placed successfully in the CBD.\\n\\n4. Opacified portion of pancreatic duct in the head was normal.\\n\\nAdditional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\\n(attending physician) and ERCP fellow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrief Hospital Course:\\nA/P: 67 yo male, h/o severe 3vd, RA, presenting from OSH with\\n?biliary sepsis, s/p ERCP with stent placed, being treated for\\nurosepsis vs biliary sepsis, extubated and doing well.\\n\\n1. Sepsis: The patient's initial picture was consistent with\\nseptic + cardiogenic shock. Initial SG numbers revealed high\\nSVR, low CO, and high PCWP. He remained hypotensive despite IVF,\\nand pressors were continued, with eventual triple pressor\\ntherapy (Levo, Dopamine and Vasopressin) required for\\nhemodynamic support. A random cortisol was 20, and 29\\npost-cosyntropin. Despite appropriate response, the low random\\ncortisol prompted initiation of steroid therapy, initially\\nDexamethasone, then hydrocortisone and Fludrocortisone with plan\\nto complete 7 days of Rx (completed). His lactate, elevated on\\nadmission, came down. He was successfully weaned off Levo and\\nVasopressin on [**2195-12-28**], then off Dopamine on [**2195-12-29**]. ERCP did\\nnot show obstruction, ?biliary sludge.  He was initially on\\nvanco/zosyn/flagyl-->cipro/vanco/flagyl.  Vanco/flagyl were\\ndiscontinued on [**12-27**] (c. diff neg x 3), and he will continue a\\ncourse of cipro for ?urosepsis.  All cultures here have been\\nNGTD, but he is being treated for [**4-26**] E. coli blood culture\\nbottles at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**].  Ciprofloxacin was continued for the 14 day\\ncourse (until [**1-9**]).  He was hemodynamically stable throughout\\nhospitalization.  Blood pressure medications were initially held\\n[**2-23**] hypotension.  Lisinopril was restarted prior to discharge\\nafter renal function improved.  Atenolol was held given patient\\nwas still on amiodarone taper.  This should be restarted after\\nhe follows up with his PCP/cardiologist.\\n\\n2. NSTEMI: The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was complicated by\\ntroponin elevation felt secondary to demand in the setting of\\nacute illness (peak troponin 1.86). He received 48 hours of\\nintravenous heparin, D/C'd in the setting of thrombocytopenia.\\nAn echo was performed on [**12-25**], which revealed severe global LV\\nhypokinesis with EF<25%. Cardiology followed in-house.\\nLisinopril, ASA, were continued. Lipitor was added upon\\ndischarge at a lower dose, and atenolol was held.  This should\\nbe restarted when amiodarone taper is completed and he follows\\nup with his primary cardiologist.  He also had an echo in-house\\nshowing a very depressed EF (<25%), likely [**2-23**] myocardial\\nsuppression from sepsis.  He should have a follow up TTE after\\ndischarge from rehab.\\n\\n3. Afib: Patient went into atrial fibrillation on [**12-25**] with RVR\\nand hypotension. Cardioversion was attempted without success. He\\nwas loaded with amiodarone IV and an amiodarone drip was\\ninitiated. He converted to NSR in PM. Then, he reverted back\\ninto afib on [**12-26**] after an increase in dopamine dose to 3\\n(?true-true and unrelated?). Given low cardiac output and\\nongoing hypotension requiring 3 pressors, cardioversion was\\nperformed with conversion to NSR after a single 200J shock. The\\npatient was switched to PO amiodarone on [**12-26**], to be continued\\nTID until [**1-2**], then [**Hospital1 **] for 1 week, then QD for 1 week, then\\n200 mg PO QD until cardiology follow-up. He remained in NSR\\nthroughout hospitalization after transfer out of the unit.  His\\natenolol was held and should be restarted after he finishes his\\namiodarone taper and follows up with his cardiologist, Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was started on fondaparinux/coumadin for\\nanticoagulation (afib and low EF).  Goal INR is [**2-24**],\\nfondaparinux can be d/c'ed when INR=1.8.\\n\\n4. ARF on CRF: Per patient's PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], baseline\\ncreatinine around 1.3-1.5. Peak creatinine 3.0 at OSH. Mr. [**Known lastname **]\\nwas initially oliguric on admission. His urine output slowly\\nimproved with better hemodynamics, with slowly improving\\ncreatinine. Urine lytes suggestive of renal etiology (likely ATN\\n[**2-23**] hypotension from sepsi), and urine sediment bland. Currently\\n2.1, and auto-diuresing and mobilising fluid. RUS without\\nevidence of hydronephrosis or other abnormality.  His creatinine\\nreturned to baseline (1.3) and was stable on discharge.  He\\ndiuresed very well on IV lasix (goal 2L/d).  He was discharge on\\nPO bumex 1 mg daily.  This should be continued until he is\\nclinically euvolemic and his peripheral edema is resolved.\\n\\n5. Transaminitis: s/p ERCP with stent placement, but only\\nfinding of sludge. Query transaminitis in setting of sepsis.\\nLFT's were back to normal at time of discharge.  They should be\\nchecked within a week of discharge.  Lipitor was restarted at\\nlower dose upon discharge and can be titrated up.\\n\\n7. Thrombocytopenia: While in ICU, platelets were noted to drop\\nto a nadir in the 80s. Concern for HIT was raised and Heparin\\nwas discontinued after 48 hours of therapy. HIT screen negative.\\nPicture no c/w DIC. Ultimately, thrombocytopenia was felt\\nmedication-induced, query direct effect of Heparin versus\\nantibiotics (vanco, Flagyl). Now slowly rising.  This was likley\\nmultifactorial in the setting of sepsis, medications, pressors\\nand not [**2-23**] heparin.  Platelets continued to go up and were\\nstable at time of discharge.\\n\\n8.  ?Glucose intolerance: continue on SSI, no history of DM,\\nlikely in setting of steroids for sepsis.  SSI should be\\ncontinued as long as pt has abnormal blood sugars.  If this\\nintolerance persists, PCP should recommend further therapy.\\n\\n9.  Code: Full\\n\\n10.

Please follow these\\nguidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you\\notherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any\\nquestions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.\\n.\\nACTIVITY:\\n.\\nThere are restrictions on activity. On the side of your\\namputation you are non weight bearing until cleared by your\\nSurgeon. You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever\\npossible.\\n.\\nYou may use the other leg to assist in transferring and pivots.\\nBut try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site\\nwhen transferring and or pivoting. Please keep knee immobilizer\\non at all times to help keep the amputation site straight.\\n.\\nNo driving until cleared by your Surgeon.\\n.\\nPLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:\\n.\\nRedness in or drainage from your leg wound(s) .\\n.\\nWatch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever\\ngreater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus\\ndraining from the incision site. If you experience any of these\\nor bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.\\n.\\nExercise:\\n.\\nLimit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.\\n.\\nDo not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.\\n.\\nTry to keep leg elevated when able.\\n.\\nBATHING/SHOWERING:\\n.\\nYou may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A\\ndressing may cover you??????re amputation site and this should be\\nleft in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this time and\\nwash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You will have\\nsutures, which are usually removed in 3 weeks. This will be done\\nby the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.\\n.\\nWOUND CARE:\\n.\\nAn appointment will be made for you to return for suture\\nremoval.\\n.\\nWhen the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place\\npieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will\\nstay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these\\ndo not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm\\nwater and soap in the shower.\\n.\\nAvoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for\\nfour weeks after surgery.\\n.\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n.\\nUnless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the\\nmedications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a\\nnew prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every\\nthree (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.\\n.\\nRemember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you\\nshould increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check\\nwith your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel\\nthat you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may\\nuse over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite\\nsuppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small\\nbalanced meals throughout the day.\\n.\\nCAUTIONS:\\n.\\nNO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is\\nan important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of\\nyour blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you\\nsmoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse\\nor doctor for information on smoking cessation.\\n.\\nAvoid pressure to your amputation site.\\n.\\nNo strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.\\n.\\nDIET :\\n.\\nThere are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.\\nPoor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent\\nmeals may be preferred.\\n.\\nFor people with vascular problems we would recommend a\\ncholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and\\nlow in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile\\nin your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in\\nserum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a\\nreduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that\\nmost people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to\\ndecrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the\\nbad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density\\nLipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's\\npermission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred\\nor get a referral from your doctor.\\n.\\nIf you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight\\nmanagement program. Your health and its improvement depend on\\nit. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be\\neasy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new\\nattitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get\\na referral from your doctor.\\n.\\nIf you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may\\nrequest a referral from your doctor.\\n.\\nFOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:\\n.\\nBe sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your\\nimproving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the\\nchronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood\\npressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to\\nthe blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!\\n.\\nPlease call the office on the first working day after your\\ndischarge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This\\nshould be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days\\nafter discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday\\nthrough Friday.\\n.\\nPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR\\nQUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE\\n\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\n7-14 weeks Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], call for an appointment [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**]\\n3weeks for removal of sutures in Dr.[**Name (NI) 1392**] office\\nProvider:  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] INFUSION Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1652**] Date/Time:[**2152-11-14**]\\n7:50\\n\\n\\n\\nCompleted by:[**2152-10-24**]\"]\n",

It is unclear exactly why this occurred but we suspect\\nyou may have some predisposition toward forming blood clots.\\nTherefore, you have been started on blood thinners to prevent\\nfuther such events.  You have been started on coumadin as a long\\nterm blood thinner, you are being discharged on enoxaparin, a\\nblood thinner, while we await your coumadin level to be\\ntherapeutic.  You will need to see a hematologist as an\\noutpatient to complete your clotting disorder workup.\\n\\nYou had fevers in the hospital.  Because of the imaging findings\\nin your kidney we could not rule out a kidney infection.\\nTherefore, you received 14 days of therapy for a presumed kidney\\ninfection.  You completed this prior to discharge.  Your\\ncontinued fevers and pain are likely due to an inflammatory\\nreaction as your body breaks down the portions of kidney tissue\\nthat died.  You can take acetaminophen for these fevers as\\nneeded.  Unfortunately, this inflammatory reaction also causes\\npain, which we have treated with multiple pain medicines.\\n\\nYou will need follow up with a primary care provider and\\ncoumadin clinic to follow how thin your blood is.  You will also\\nneed follow up with a kidney doctor to follow your kidney\\nfunction, a hematologist to assess you for a predisposition to\\nclotting and help manage this, and a rheumatologist as some of\\nyour tests suggest a possible autoimmune disorder.  We have\\nscheduled these appointments for you.\\n\\nYour medications have been changed.  You have been started on\\ncoumadin, a blood thinner, that you will need to take until your\\nare told to stop by a doctor.  Your blood has not yet been\\nthinned enough by coumadin so you are also being discharged on\\nENOXAPARIN(LOVENOX), which will keep your blood thin until your\\ncoumadin levels are adequate.  When your coumadin levels are\\nadequate for 24 hours you can stop the enoxaparin.  You have\\nalso been started on MORPHINE sustained release and immediate\\nrelease for pain.  You should not drive while using these\\nmedications as they can make you sleepy.  You were also started\\non GABAPENTIN (NEURONTIN) to help manage your pain.\\n\\nPlease seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest\\npain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or any change from\\nyour baseline health status\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nMD: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD\\nSpecialty: PCP\\nDate and time: Friday, [**2125-10-12**] at 1:45 pm\\nLocation: [**Location (un) **], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Bldg, [**Location (un) **]\\nPhone number: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]\\n\\nMD: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1366**]\\nSpecialty: Nephrology\\nDate and time: Wednesday, [**2128-11-7**]:00\\nLocation: [**Location (un) **], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Bldg, [**Location (un) 436**]\\nPhone number: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 721**]\\n\\nMD: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6944**]\\nSpecialty: Hematology\\nDate and time: Wednesday, [**Month (only) 1096**]\\nLocation:  [**Location (un) **], [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Bldg, [**Location (un) 436**]\\nPhone number: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 68451**]']\n",

We were concerned that your headache might be from a\\n[**Hospital1 **] in your head but the ct scan of your head did not show any\\nbleeding. We asked for your permission to look at your\\ncerebrospinal fluid to confirm that you did not have a [**Hospital1 **] in\\nyour head, but you initially refused. We told you that if we\\nmiss [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in your head that could result in another larger\\nhead [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] later, possibly even deadly, and you said you\\nunderstood this risk. We did check an MRI of your head to see if\\nwe could see any blood vesels likely to [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and that showed\\ndid not show a source of bleeding. Your headaches eventually\\nresolved after addition of fioricet, but then then returned in\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**].  A lumbar puncture was eventually performed by\\ninterventional radiology and your CSF fluid was negative for\\nbleeding or infection.  Your nifedipine was also discontinued\\nand switched to verapimil to help your headache. Your headache\\ncontinued to persist. The pain service was consulted and a very\\nstrong medication, Dilaudid was suggested. We stopped your\\nfiorcet as this did not appear to help your pain anymore, and\\ngave you dilaudid for your pain. This helped your headaches\\nmildly. We tried to change your pain medication to different\\ndrugs (ms contin and low dose topomax), but this made you very\\nsleepy for several days. We stopped all of these medications\\nplus all strong sedating medications, such as dilaudid,\\ngabapentin, and ambien. You were continued on tylenol alone for\\npain control, and surprisingly, this alleviated your headaches.\\nYou are advised to not take these sedating medications any more\\nas it is very difficult for your body and kidneys to process\\nthese medications. On the day of discharge, you were headache\\nfree.\\n\\nYour blood pressure was also very high during this hospital\\nstay. It appeared to be quite higher on your hemodialysis days.\\nWe continued all of your medications on your [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2286**] days. We\\nalso increased the dosage of several of your medications as well\\nas added new medications that are listed below. During your\\nhospital stay, you were briefly transferred to the intensive\\ncare unit for closer evaluation of your elevated blood pressure.\\nYou were monitored closely and your blood pressures decreased.\\nYou were transferred back to the general floor. More blood\\npressure medications were added and your blood pressure became\\nideally controlled. Your new regimen is below.\\n\\nYou also developed double vision which we feel is secondary to a\\nnerve in your eye that is not working correctly caused by your\\ndiabetes. This may reverse, but you may need surgery in the\\nfuture to correct this. You will be followed up by\\nNeuro-opthomology for further evaluation of this.\\n\\nWhen you came in you also had chest pain, but we do not think\\nyou had a heart attack.\\n\\nYou also had significant nausea and vomiting during your\\nhospital stay. We gave you strong medications to help this. You\\neventually were able to tolerate food and medications. You will\\nbe discharged on a home dose of an anti-nausea medication,\\nreglan.\\n\\nWhen you go back to rehab, your new medications are as follows:\\n\\nYOUR NEW BLOOD PRESSURE REGIMEN:\\nVerapamil 240 mg every 12 hours\\nValsartan 320 mg every night\\nLisinopril 80 mg daily\\nMinoxidil 5 mg twice a day\\nClonidine patch 0.1 mg to be applied every saturday (keep on all\\nweek)\\n\\nPAIN CONTROL:\\nLidocaine 5% patch, apply 12 hours on and 12 hours off as needed\\nfor flank pain\\nTylenol 1000 mg every eight hours for headache.

There, you were found to have multiple\\nmedical problems, including [**Name2 (NI) **] clots in your lungs as well as\\nevidence of a minor heart attack based on [**Name2 (NI) **] tests.\\nAdditionally, you were found to have very low red [**Name2 (NI) **] cell\\ncount.  You were given bags of [**Name2 (NI) **] to replete your low counts,\\nand placed on [**Name2 (NI) **] thinners in an attempt to treat the clots in\\nyour lungs.  Your small heart attack affected the way your heart\\ncould pump, and as a result the doctors at your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] hospital\\nsuggested you come to [**Hospital1 **] for further\\nevaluation\\n  At [**Hospital1 **], you had a procedure called a cardiac catherization.\\nThis is a procedure where a catheter is inserted in the large\\nvessel in your groin, and wired to the heart.  Dye was injected\\nto analyze the vessels in your heart, known as the coronary\\narteries.  There evidence of severe coronary artery disease,\\nwhich causes the [**Hospital1 **] vessels to become blocked off.  This\\nfinding was concering, as it increases your risk of a severe\\nheart attack.  Your doctors informed [**Name5 (PTitle) **] of this finding, and\\nsuggested you have surgery known as a \"Triple Bypass\" surgery,\\nto circumvent the blocks in your coronary arteries.  However,\\nafter you were told about the risks and benefits of having the\\nsurgery, you decided this is not a procedure you would want\\nperformed at this time.\\n  Because you declined to have the surgery, we have attempted to\\nmedically optimize your medication regimen.  It is important to\\ncontinue to take your medications as prescribed, to help reduce\\nyour risk of having another, larger, heart attack in the future.\\n\\n  Additionally, you have been placed on medication to treat the\\n[**Name5 (PTitle) **] clots in your lungs.  The first medication is called\\n\"Lovenox\" or \"Enoxaparin\".  It is injection you give yourself\\ntwice a day.  The second drug is called \"Warfarin\" or\\n\"Coumadin\".  It is a pill you will take to help keep your blodo\\nthin.  As warfarin takes some time to work, it is important you\\ntake enoxaparin in the interim to help keep your [**Name5 (PTitle) **] thin\\nwhile warfarin starts to work in your body.  Please use the\\nenoxaparin injections for 10 days or as arranged by your PCP.\\n   [**Name10 (NameIs) **] is unclear why your red [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cell count was low when you\\ncame to the hospital.

The\\nrheumatology team evaluated and took fluid from your knee. You\\nwere initially treated with antibiotic for possible infection\\nand pain medications. The fluid was cultured for infection but\\nthis was negative.  You did have a blood culture that was\\npositive and we provided you with a two week course of\\nantibiotics.  We also had interventional radiology and vascular\\nsurgery to help drain the fluids from your leg.  This helped\\nyour swelling.

You are now on a\\nmuch more conservative pain regimen. You will follow up with\\npain doctors as [**Name5 (PTitle) **] outpatient.

Your warfarin was stopped and should not be continued\\ndue to further risk of bleeding. You should stop aspirin\\ncurrently and restrat at 325mg daily in 1 week. We also started\\natorvastatin for high cholesterol as your cholesterol was found\\nto be high. This should be repeated in 3 months time. Your\\nkidney function tests were also slightly abnormal following the\\nCT contrast and this will be followed at rehab. You were\\ncontinued on your other home medications. The most likely cause\\nof this brain hemorrhage was high blood pressure although given\\nyour pacemaker we were unable to do an MRI. As a result you will\\nneed to have a repeat CT scan in 6 weeks  as at this point the\\nblood should have reabsorbed and we will be able to look to see\\nif there is any lesion underlying your hemorrhage.

During your hospitalization, your blood\\nsugar, electrolytes, and metabolism, in general, were restored\\nto a more normal condition.\\n\\nIt is extremely important that you keep your blood sugars at\\nmore normal levels or this life-threatening condition will\\nhappen again. Also, you will develop eye problems, kidney\\ndisease, worse leg numbness, and heart disease if your sugars\\nare not controlled better.\\n\\nIn order to control your sugars, you need to follow the Insulin\\nregimen that was prescribed by the [**Last Name (un) **] center. You will have\\nto take 2 types of insulin. You will take a dose of long acting\\ninsulin (Lantus) every night and this dose will be constant. You\\nwill take a dose of Humalog insulin before every meal based on\\nthe sliding scale chart - thus you have to check your sugar at\\nthis time.\\n\\nIf you find that you are unable to follow the above insulin\\nplan, you have to call your doctor at the [**Hospital **] clinic.\\n\\nDue to your high use of Motrin before admission, you irritated\\nthe lining of your stomach. Thus, we treated this problem with a\\nmedicine to decrease the acid in your stomach called\\npantoprazole. You should continue taking this medicine until you\\nsee your PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 10748**] your stomach problem.\\n\\nIf you begin to again experience increasing nausea, vomitting,\\nabdominal pain, or any other concerning symptom, you should\\ncontact your PCP or go to the ER.\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nYou need to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3636**] for diabetes care.\\nYour first appointment is [**4-29**] at 4PM.

You initially were sent\\nto the cardiac ICU where medications were used to support your\\nblood pressure. You had a cat-scan of your abdomen to see if\\nthere was something obstructing your kidenys. You received\\ncontrast with this CT and medications after the CT to protect\\nyour kineys from the contrast. Your warfarin was stopped for a\\ncouple days because we thought you might need additional\\nproceedures with high risk of bleeding. We also stopped many of\\nyour blood pressure medications because you had such a low blood\\npressure initially. Your kidney function has improved and should\\ncontinue to improve and your blood pressure has come back up so\\nwe have restarted some blood pressure medications. Your INR is\\ncurrently slightly less than 2 even though we have restarted\\nyour warfarin so you will get a shot of lovenox today and give\\nyourself 1 shot of lovenox tomorrow to make sure your blood is\\nthin enough until you are seen in clinic on Monday. While you\\nwere in the hospital there was also initially some concern that\\nyou had a stroke. The neurologic service came to see you and\\nsaid you did not have a stroke but may have experienced what we\\ncall a TIA with no residual symptoms.\\nYou will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on Monday where you\\nwill have your INR and electrolytes checked.\\n\\nThe following changes were made to your medications:\\n- Start carvedilol 25mg by mouth twice each day for blood\\npressure\\n- Increase home furosemide to 80mg by mouth once each day for\\nfluid\\n- Start enoxaparin 80mg sub-cutaneously for 1 day (only take\\nthis medication on Saturday, then stop)\\n- Your insulin coverage was changed to NPH 70/30 taking 15 units\\nin the morning and 15 units in the evening with a sliding scale\\nto cover your meal time insulin (see attached sheet)\\n- Continue your home Atorvastatin, warfarin, plavix, aspirin,\\nfolic acid\\n- Stop all your other home medications for now until further\\ninstructed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]: stop minoxidil, hydralazine, isosorbide\\nmononitrate, spironolactone, cilostazol, atenolol, benicar, your\\nformer sliding scale.\\n\\nWeigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more\\nthan 3 lbs. Please give yourself your enoxaparin shot on\\nSaturday as mentioned above. Please make sure to check your\\nblood sugars before each meal and give yourself the additional\\ninsulin as instructed by the attached insulin slidding scale.\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nYou have a follow-up appointment scheduled on Monday [**2204-4-16**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You will have your INR and electrolytes\\nchecked at this visit.\\n\\nYou also have a follow-up appointment scheduled with your PCP\\n[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].

While your kidneys looked fine there were the following\\nfindings which should be discussed with your PCP at next visit.\\n1. Unusually large appendix (12 mm diameter) but no secondary\\nsigns of appendicitis. This may represent a mucocele, and\\nelective resection should be considered.\\n2.

A G-tube for tube feeding and a port\\nfor chemotherapy were placed.  The tumor biopsy confirmed\\nsquamous cell carcinoma (cancer) and you were transferred to the\\nOncology floor to start chemotherapy.  MRI of the brain did not\\nshow any cancer in the brain.  Video swallow evaluation showed\\nsevere aspiration of food and liquids.  You cannot eat or drink\\nuntil this is re-evaluated.  All of your nutrition must come\\nthrough tube feeds.  Tube feeds were started and you developed\\nhigh blood sugars managed with insulin.\\n.\\nChemotherapy was difficult to tolerate.  You needed several\\ndifferent types of anti-nausea medications.  All of your blood\\ncounts became very low from the chemotherapy.  You developed\\nfevers and pneumonia that were treated in the Intensive Care\\nUnit with IV antibiotics.  You also developed a stroke with\\nleft-sided weakness.  The stroke likely originated from a blood\\nclot in the right leg that traveled in the blood stream and\\npassed through a hole in the heart (patent foramen ovale) and\\nthen into the brain and kidney also causing some kidney damage.\\nYou were started on a blood thinner for this.  To prevent\\ndifficulty breathing from future radiation therapy, a\\ntracheostomy was placed.  However, this was complicated by\\nbleeding and the blood thinner was not able to be restarted.\\nYou also developed a rash on your left forehead.  Culture\\nconfirmed this was shingles.  You were treated with an\\nanti-viral drug acyclovir and a pain medicine gabapentin for it.\\n.\\nYou developed recurrent pneumonia and were started on IV\\nantibiotics.  You coughed out your trach tube, but this was\\nreplaced.  You started daily radiation treatment [**10-10**],\\nMonday through Friday for 6 weeks.  You will also be treated\\nwith weekly cetuximab immunotherapy during your radiation.  Your\\nfirst dose was on [**2108-10-3**].  As radiation therapy continues, your\\ncough may worsen and require more suctioning.\\n\\nTRANSITION ISSUES:\\n1. You will return to [**Hospital1 18**] for daily radiation therapy, Monday\\nto Friday, for 6 weeks.\\n2. You will receive weekly cetuximab infusion therapy weekly\\nuntil radiation therapy is completed.\\n3. You will be going to a rehab center for physical therapy.\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nYOU WILL NEED TO FOLLOW-UP WITH YOUR ONCOLOGIST DR.

Please follow these\\nguidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you\\notherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any\\nquestions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.\\n\\nACTIVITY:\\n\\nThere are no specific restrictions on activity other than no\\nlifting an object heavier than twenty-five (25) pounds for the\\nfirst three (3) months. Gradually increase your level of\\nactivity back to normal depending on how you feel. Fatigue is\\nnormal, especially for the first month postoperative. Resume\\ndriving when you feel strong enough and comfortable enough\\nwithout needing pain medication.\\n\\nPLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:\\n\\nSevere and worsening abdominal pain .\\n\\nPain or swelling in one of your legs.\\n\\nIncreasing pain, redness or drainage related to your incision(s)\\n\\nWatch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever\\ngreater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus\\ndraining from the incision site. If you experience any of these\\nor bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.\\n\\nExercise:\\n\\nLimit strenuous activity for 8 weeks.\\n\\nResume driving when you feel strong enough and comfortable\\nenough without needing pain medication .\\n\\nNo heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for 8 weeks.\\n\\nAvoid excessive bending at the hips and stooping for 4 weeks.\\n\\nBATHING/SHOWERING:\\n\\nYou may shower immediately if the incision is dry upon coming\\nhome. No baths until sutures / staples are removed. Dissolving\\nsutures may have been used. In either case, you can wash your\\nincision gently with soap and water.\\n\\nWOUND CARE:\\n\\nSuture / Staples may be removed before discharge. If they are\\nnot, an appointment will be made for you to return for staple\\nremoval.\\n\\nWhen the sutures / staples are removed the doctor may or may not\\nplace pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision.\\nThese will stay on about a week and you may shower with them on.\\nIf these do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off\\nwith warm water and soap in the shower.\\n\\nAvoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for\\ntwo weeks after surgery.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:\\n\\nYou may resume taking medication you were on prior to your\\nsurgery unless specifically instructed otherwise by your\\nphysician [**Name9 (PRE) **] will be given a new prescription for pain\\nmedication, which should be taken every three (3) to four (4)\\nhours only if necessary.\\n\\nRemember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you\\nshould increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check\\nwith your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel\\nthat you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may\\nuse over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite\\nsuppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small\\nbalanced meals throughout the day.\\n\\nCAUTIONS:\\n\\nNO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is\\nan important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of\\nyour blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you\\nsmoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse\\nor doctor for information on smoking cessation.\\n\\nAvoid heavy lifting (over 20 pounds) for 8 weeks after surgery.\\n\\nNo strenuous activity for 4-6 weeks after surgery.\\n\\nDIET:\\n\\nThere are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively.\\nPoor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent\\nmeals may be preferred.\\n\\nFor people with vascular problems we would recommend a\\ncholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and\\nlow in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile\\nin your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in\\nserum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a\\nreduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that\\nmost people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to\\ndecrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the\\nbad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density\\nLipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's\\npermission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred\\nor get a referral from your doctor.\\n\\nIf you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight\\nmanagement program. Your health and its improvement depend on\\nit. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be\\neasy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new\\nattitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get\\na referral from your doctor.\\n\\nIf you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may\\nrequest a referral from your doctor.\\n\\nFOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT:\\n\\nBe sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your\\nimproving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the\\nchronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood\\npressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to\\nthe blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!\\n\\nPlease call the office on the first working day after your\\ndischarge from the hospital to schedule a follow-up visit. This\\nshould be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days\\nafter discharge. Normal office hours are 8:30-5:30 Monday\\nthrough Friday.\\n\\nPLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR\\nQUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.\\n\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nCalll Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3121**].
