There was debris visible with\\nin the stent at early cholangiogram. Occulsion cholangiograqm\\nrevealed extensive stricturing of both left and right\\nintrahepatic ducts. Although a small left intrahepatic radical\\nopacified, it was not possible to advance the balloon catheter\\nin this direction. For this reason, no stent could be\\nintroduced. Balloon sweeps were performed from just above the\\nstent and down through the stent, and a moderate amount of\\ndebris was removed. Even after multiple sweeps, there was some\\nfilling defect left in the upperprotion of the stent, consistent\\nwith a degree of tumor ingrowth. Sticture not amenable to ERCP,\\nand suggested PTCA as next intervention if futher obstructive\\nsymptoms occur.
